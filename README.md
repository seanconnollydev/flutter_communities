# Usage

Generate GraphQL types:
```bash
fvm flutter pub run build_runner build --delete-conflicting-outputs
```

# Fauna

The final app is built with several [User-Defined Functions](https://docs.fauna.com/fauna/current/learn/understanding/user_defined_functions) and other FQL statements. The FQL for these can be copy and pasted from the [Fauna_FQL.md](Fauna_FQL.md) doc file.

Debug FQL statements:
`Abort(Format("%@", VALUE_TO_BE_CHECKED))`
